               Khimmaster LLC was established in 2012 by Mr. Manvel Gabrielyan with a vision of preserving of the most valuable natural resources of motherland â€“ water. Through thorough research and many meetings with leading companies in the sphere of wastewater treatment worldwide a decision was made to cooperate with Czech company Topolwater which has more than 40 years of experience in the field of designing, producing and installing Wastewater Treatment Plants (WWTP) in strict European market.

               In 2014 the first locally produced plant was installed in the Southern region of Armenia. Despite the lack of interest and much governal enforcement of environmental laws, the company continually invested in the research and grew it's production capacities.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               In 2017 our head of engineering department was hired, who by then had more than 25 years of experience in the filed of wastewater and water treatment abroad, which started a new cycle in our production. A new technology was implemented in the production which enabled us to make the plants more cost-efficient.
